This project is like a C++ reference book for me. Using gtest to define behavior and knowledge.

## [CPP](./cpp)
Cpp examples and sandbox mostly from *Effective C++, Effective Modern C++* and *C++ templates*

## [Data Structure](./ds)
Data structure I learned, I won't and can't write it as complex as STL. I can only simply write down the basic idea and algorithm.

## [Multi-threading](./mt)
Test code when reading book *C++ Concurrency in Action*

## [Snippet](./snippet)
Snippet code is mostly from solving [leetcode](https://leetcode-cn.com/u/ymy1248/) problems.
