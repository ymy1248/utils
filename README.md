This project is also like a C++ reference book for me.

## CPP 
Directory: [./cpp](./cpp)

Cpp examples and sandbox mostly from *Effective C++, Effective Modern C++ and C++ templates*

## Data Structure
Directory: [./ds](./ds)

Data structure I learned, I won't and can't write it as complex as STL. I can only simply write down the basic idea and algorithm.

## Multi-threading
Directory: [./mt](./mt)

Test code when reading book *C++ Concurrency in Action*

## Snippet
Some snippet code for some util functions.
